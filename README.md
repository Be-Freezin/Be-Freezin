**`Digital Druid (Developer/Musician/Gamer/Design Tinkerer)`**

I'm a front-end developer with a passion for creating amazing web experiences, and responsive web applications. All coding projects are built from the ground up by yours truly.

I'm a believer in clean code and pixel-perfect design. I'm obsessed with creating intuitive user interfaces that are easy to navigate and visually stunning. Whether it's a small tweak or a major overhaul, I'm always up for a challenge and love solving complex problems with code.

When im not programming, i enjoy creating music, exploring sounds and sound design, slaying foes in RPG's, exploring new recipes and cocktails with my wife, traveling to fun and unique places and cheering for the Philadelphia 76ers.

## My Coding Adventure
As a kid i've always been enthralled in the world of tech and video games. Young and naive, i didn't think to much about it. As i got older and was seeking a new career path, a friend suggested programming to me after i moved to Chicago, IL.
I very quickly became hooked on it and instantly gravitated towards it. Programming is relaxing to me, it's something i genuinely look forward to.
I've always been a creative person and im constantly looking for an outlet. With coding i can use my creativeness in a unique way. Coding as very quickly become my favorite hobby and i've been sinking countless hours into it, gearing up to land my first job in tech. With a strong eagerness to learn and grow both as a developer and a person, im willing to get my hands dirty and do whatever it takes to make a name for myself in tech.
