**`TheMetalHeadDev (Developer/UI Designer/Musician/Gamer)`**

Iâ€™m a frontend developer passionate about writing maintainable, scalable code that powers user-friendly interfaces. My development approach is guided by a strong design sensibility, ensuring that every line of code supports both form and function.

I focus on building efficient, maintainable solutions that not only work seamlessly but also feel right to users, catching their eye and attention. If youâ€™re looking for a developer who values both creativity and logic, then youâ€™re in the right place!

Since the start of 2024 I have been on contract as a UI Developer where we are using bitbucket.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy creating music, exploring sounds and sound design, slaying foes in RPG's, exploring new recipes and cocktails with my wife, traveling to fun and unique places and cheering for the Philadelphia 76ers.

## My Coding Adventure
As a kid i've always been enthralled in the world of tech and video games. Young and naive, i didn't think to much about it. As i got older and was seeking a new career path, a friend suggested programming to me after i moved to Chicago, IL.
I very quickly became hooked on it and instantly gravitated towards it. Programming is relaxing to me, it's something i genuinely look forward to.
I've always been a creative person and im constantly looking for an outlet. With coding i can use my creativeness in a unique way. Coding as very quickly become my favorite hobby and i've been sinking countless hours into it, gearing up to land my first job in tech. With a strong eagerness to learn and grow both as a developer and a person, im willing to get my hands dirty and do whatever it takes to make a name for myself in tech.
